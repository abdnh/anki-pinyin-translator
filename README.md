Anki add-on that imports English words from CSV/text files, pulls Pinyin translation and audio files from Google Translate,
and generates notes.

You can access the add-on from the Tools menu.

The add-on comes with with a simple English-Pinyin notetype that is used for generating the notes.
More flexible options to specify the field mappings and use your own custom notetypes may be added in the future.

Only tested on Anki 2.1.50+, but may work on as far as 2.1.17.

## TODO

- [ ] do not add duplicates
- [ ] add dialog for flexible field mappings instead of dictating the use of our template
- [ ] use csv.Sniffer to detect the format of CSV files.
